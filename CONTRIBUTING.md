# Contributing to coding

If you're reading this, you're awesome! Thank you for helping us make this project great and being a part of the coding community. Here are a few guidelines that will help you along the way.

### Code of Conduct

Working on your first Pull Request? 

   Fork the repository.

    Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote
    mkdir coding
    git clone https://github.com/rahulkotha18/coding.git  coding
    cd coding
    git checkout master
    git pull upstream master

   Create a new topic branch:

    git checkout -b <your name>

If you want to add solutions to a problem on [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com), [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/), create a new file as  

    <problem number>_<problem name>.java  (eg: 42_RainWater.java)

or if you want to add solutions to problems on other competitive coding websites, you are welcome to add a new folder specifying the website
(eg: if you want to work on Hackerrank problems, create a new `HackerRank` folder and add files to it)

or if you want to work on general problems, create a new file in the `General/` specifying the problem description as a comment in the file.

When you're finished making changes, commit your code and push to your fork:

    git push -u origin <your name>

Then go to the repository and make a Pull Request.
    
 THANK YOU!
